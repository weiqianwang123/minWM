# 🌍 minWM: The First Full-Stack Open-Source World Model Framework

>  ***A full-stack framework and tutorial for newcomers, rather than a specific model.***

**minWM** is our contribution to the world-model community: a **full-stack open-source framework** that walks you end-to-end through turning a bidirectional T2V foundation model into an action-conditioned video world model — with example data, runnable scripts, **Claude skills** capturing our hands-on experience, and **onboarding knowledge** for newcomers. We hope more researchers and developers join us in growing the community together.

## ✨ Why minWM?

### 1. Full-Stack Framework

The complete **data → training → inference** pipeline is open-sourced; every stage exposes input/output checkpoints so you can stop, swap, or fork anywhere.

**1.1 Data.** We walk you through how to construct training-ready datasets paired with camera poses, and the full data processing pipeline that turns them into latents.

**1.2 Training.** Including FSDP + sequence parallelism, single-/multi-node training, and the full distillation pipeline from a bidirectional diffusion model to a 4-step AR student:

```
Phase 1                            Phase 2 — Distillation to Causal Few-Step
─────────────────────              ────────────────────────────────────────────
Bidirectional SFT      ──▶   Stage 1   Teacher Forcing AR Diffusion
                             Stage 2a  Causal ODE  (proposed in [Causal Forcing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02214))
                             Stage 2b  Causal CD   (proposed in [Causal Forcing++](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.15141))
                             Stage 3   Asymmetric DMD with Self Rollout
                                                ▼
                                         4-step real-time
```

**1.3 Inference.**

- ✅ 4-step DMD inference for HY Action2V / HY TI2V / Wan Action2V, multi-GPU sequence parallelism, camera-trajectory control via pose strings (`"a*4,w*8,s*7"`) or JSON files
- 🚧 Inference acceleration [TBD]

### 2. Multi-Backbone Support

minWM supports two paths to arriving at an interactive world model.

#### 2.1 From Scratch: Bidirectional T2V Foundation → Real-Time World Model

The HunyuanVideo 1.5 and Wan 2.1 lines walk through the full 4-stage pipeline — starting from a bidirectional T2V foundation model and ending at a 4-step autoregressive world model.


| Backbone             | Architecture          | Params | Training       | Inference    |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | ------ | -------------- | ------------ |
| **Wan 2.1**          | Cross-attention + DiT | 1.3 B  | ✅ all 4 stages | ✅ 4-step DMD |
| **HunyuanVideo 1.5** | MMDiT                 | 8 B    | ✅ all 4 stages | ✅ 4-step DMD |



Both lines share the same trainer / loss / dataset abstractions, so adding a third backbone is structurally a wrapper-and-config exercise.

#### 2.2 Finetuning an Existing Video World Model 🚧 [TBD]

The forthcoming `worldplay-finetune` entry will let you start from an already-trained video world model and adapt it to new conditions, scenes, or resolutions — without rerunning the 4-stage pipeline from scratch.

### 3. Multi-Condition Injection

We aim to support both multiple condition types and multiple injection methods, mixable along either axis.

#### 3.1 Supported Conditions

- ✅ Camera pose
- 🚧 Human pose [TBD]

#### 3.2 Supported Injection Methods

- ✅ ProPE
- 🚧 Latent concat [TBD]
- 🚧 Cross-attention [TBD]

### 4. Claude Skills — Modify the Framework with an LLM Assistant
We are packaging our project experience across the CF / CF++ pipeline as Claude skills, so that an LLM assistant can help users debug failures and integrate new models without reverse-engineering the whole repo.

- 🐛 **`debug-world-model`** — collected failure modes from the training pipeline (loss NaN, frame-to-frame jitter, camera drift, memory attenuation, distillation collapse, …). Claude diagnoses likely root causes from your symptoms instead of guessing.
- 🔌 **`integrate-new-backbone`** — step-by-step recipe for plugging a new video DiT into minWM, grounded in the HunyuanVideo and Wan reference integrations — e.g. *"look at how HY does teacher forcing here, do the same for your model there"*.

### 5. Onboarding Knowledge — for Newcomers to World Models

- `onboarding-world-model`

A third Claude skill aimed at researchers entering the world-model space for the first time. Two parts:

- 🎓 **Foundations** — the minimal background to follow the pipeline: Teacher Forcing for AR diffusion training and Causal Forcing & Causal Forcing++ for AR diffusion distillation.
- 🪤 **Pitfalls** — the non-obvious mistakes we hit while building minWM, distilled so you don't repeat them.

Intended audience: graduate students, independent researchers, and junior labs that want to enter the world-model space without spending three months reverse-engineering existing repos.

### 2. Run the three demos

```bash
# 2.1  Wan Action2V (4-step DMD, camera control)
OUTPUT_FOLDER=./outputs/quickstart_wan_action2v \
TRAJECTORY_PATH="Wan21/prompts/trajectories.txt" \
    bash Wan21/scripts/inference/run_infer_causal_camera.sh

# 2.2  HY Action2V (4-step DMD, camera control)
TRANSFORMER_DIR=./ckpts/HY15/Action2V/dmd \
OUTPUT_DIR=./outputs/quickstart_hy_action2v \
    bash HY15/scripts/inference/run_infer_causal_camera.sh

# 2.3  HY TI2V (4-step DMD)
TRANSFORMER_DIR=./ckpts/HY15/TI2V/dmd \
OUTPUT_DIR=./outputs/quickstart_hy_ti2v \
    bash HY15/scripts/inference/run_infer_causal.sh

```

> **Camera control.** For HY Action2V, trajectories are read per-sample from `assets/example.json` under the `"trajectory"` field. Format: `w/s/a/d` keys with `*N` repeats; comma-separated segments — e.g. `"a*4,w*8,s*7"`.
